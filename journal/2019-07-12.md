I was working on the Te Whare Piringa booking app for most of the day (really great progress actually) so I haven't done much learning today.

I like this guy's perspective. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQBat7e0MQs I don't think I necessarily agree with everything he says, but it sounds like he's speaking from a place of actual experience.

I found my `neurons.r` project on Gist and opened it and ran it in R Studio. I'm still convinced it is not working correctly, I'm **really** looking forward to fixing it.

I've decided I can watch anymore of this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32o0DnuRjfg Even at 1.5 the speed, after a half hour, it still wasn't exciting enough. I think think I need something much quicker paced. He's obviously also a hobbyist and not a practicing Data Scientist. That's one of the things that suck about being in the big tech corporates. I definitely don't miss that.

I keep reminding myself that I should be updating my mind map as I'm taking these notes too. Okay, done. Ugh, where do I begin?!
