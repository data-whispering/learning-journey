# Data Scientist's Toolbox: Week 4: R Markdown, Scientific Thinking

## R Markdown

Looks like a variant of GitHub Flavoured Markdown.

Definitely better to use these files instead of `.r` files so you can more effectively tell the story/journey


## Types of Data Science questions

In order of difficulty:

- Descriptive
    - Describe or summarize
- Exploratory
    - Correlation does not imply causation!
    - A relationship may exist, but not why
- Inferential
    - relatively small sample of data to infer or say something about the population at large
    - accuracy depends heavily on the sampling scheme
- Predictive
    - use current and historical data to make predictions about future data
    - accuracy depends on the capturing the correct variables
    - there are many models - some are better than others for specific questions
    - generally, large data sets with simple models work well
- Causal
    - see what happens to one variable when the value of another variable is manipulated
    - the gold standard in data science (what everyone wants us to be able to do)
    - often applied to the results of randomized studies that were designed to identify causation
    - the data is usually analysed in aggregate and observed relationships are usually average effects;
- Mechanistic
    - the goal of mechanistic analysis is to understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables


## Experimental Design

As a data scientist, you are a scientist and as such, need to have the ability to design proper experiments to best answer your data science questions!
