I began working on https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview

I also read this [really good write-up on data products](https://towardsdatascience.com/designing-data-products-b6b93edf3d23), which is another aspect of this field I've been wondering about - in addition to models, what are we _building_?

- [Data Scientist vs. Machine Learning Engineer. Who Has a Cooler Job?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l05OHGUyK-E) - this offers a reasonable distinction between these 2 roles.
- [Real talk with Uber Data Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOU2Zu3h7zM)

[Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com) is a site I should add to my check-often reading list.
