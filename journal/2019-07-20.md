Read [The Death of Big Data and the Emergence of the Multi-Cloud Era](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/07/death-big-data-multi-cloud-era.html). It was a great at setting the current context in the Data space.

Also read [Top 10 Data Science Leaders You Should Follow](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/07/top-10-data-science-leaders.html). Good resource when I'm looking for more things to read and research.
