Tonight I attended the [Unsupervised Learning with Clustering Techniques](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/lrgsjpyzkbxb/) Meetup. This topic is definitely outside of my comfort zone at this point in my learning, but I find exposing myself to the broad gammut of topics and areas, it helps me to contextualize my current learning better. It also helps build up a list of other things to come back to.

I also revisited my mind map to so it will more closely reflect how I currently visualize parts of the space.

I came to the realization today that in order for me to _really_ learn data science and data engineering, I have to _become_ a data scientist. To say this is a serious undertaking would be an understatement. What I don't think many people that undertake such a massive undertaking is that it will likely cause me to alter my world view in some ways. I'll need to update my reasoning to be data-driven, sceptical, mathematical and more scientific. I need to be sure I'm tuning into this. I imagine sometimes it's going to be hard and not feel natural.

I found [this article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/09/questions-data-science-can-answer.html) as the top hit on my "kinds of questions data science can answer" search and it does a good job of describing the parts/applications of machine learning. [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com) also seems like a good place for data science/statistics news.

- [How to Learn Python for Data Science the Right Way](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/06/python-data-science-right-way.html) This is actually really good. I agree with it. It also points to some really good resources for learning Python for [data] science, such as [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-ebook/dp/B075X4LT6K) and [the Python 3 course on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). I also like the recommendation to learn to do statistics first instead of jumping straight into machine learning. Check out the article for the resources the author recommends for learning statistics.
