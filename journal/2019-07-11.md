Today is ultimately when I decided to properly learn data science and the fact I'm going to build a bootcamp curriculum while I'm learning as a means to focus the scope of my learning.

I watched most of this playlist on data analysis, which I found quite helpful: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzH6n4zXuckpfMu_4Ff8E7Z1behQks5ba

I also installed Anaconda and R Studio. `jupyter notebook` works now.
