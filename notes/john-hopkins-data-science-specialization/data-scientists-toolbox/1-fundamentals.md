# Data Scientist's Toolbox: Week 1: Fundamentals: Notes

Clearly this course is starting with the tools ... not a bad idea
Well, it's starting with some fundamentals, but the first module is on using tools

Side note: the automated videos are WAY cool. It looks like they are super easy to make using the "Ari" R package. Learn more [here](http://seankross.com/2017/09/25/Create-Videos-from-R-Markdown-Documents-with-Ari.html).

## Week 1: Fundamentals

### What is Data Science

High level:

- Data Science uses data to answer questions
- Combination of statistics, computer science, mathematics, data cleaning and formatting, and data visualization
- Someone who combines the skills of software programmer, statistician, and storyteller/artists to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data

Cause:

- More ways to collect data (cameras, microphones, sensors, phones, gps, social media, iot)
- Storage costs are the lowest they've ever been (citation needed)
- Fastest processors (CPU/GPU)
- Better software and more people

Big Data is a unique thing and can be defined as:

- Volume: large data sets
- Velocity: generated and collected faster than ever before
- Variety: structured, unstructured

Skills a data scientists embodies (venn diagram)

- Hacking skills
  - Machine learning
  - Data science
  - Danger zone!
  - I would add curiosity also
- Substanative experience
  - Machine learning
  - Data science
  - Traditional research
- Math and Statistics knowledge
  - Danger zone!
  - Data science
  - Traditional research

Process

- Make sure we have the right data and expertise for the question we're trying to answer
- Clean and format the data (requires programming)
- Analyze the data (requires stats and maths)

Focus of this course is on the last 2 sections. Programming will be on R and how to get questions answered.

Look up Hilary Mason from Fast Forward Labs, a data science company.

Also Nate Silver is pretty well known. He uses large amounts of
totally free public data to make predictions about a variety of topics. Most notably, he makes predictions about who will win elections in the United States, and has a remarkable track record for accuracy doing so.


### What is Data?

Websters: data is information, especially facts or numbers collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making.
Wikipedia: which is, a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variable

Components:

- A "set" of data, called the "population" in statistics
- Made up of variables: the measurements/values
  - Qualitative (enums, words, booleans)
  - Quantitative (ordered, numbers)


Data is collected, examined and most importantly, used to inform decisions.

A good data scientist asks questions first and seeks out relevant data second.

Quiz asks what is the most important thing about data science? (the question you're trying to answer) and also examples/attributes of qualitative and quantitative variables.


### Getting Help

This is actually really important for an online course.

Check out [Roger Peng's video on Getting Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&feature=youtu.be). And [Eric Raymond's How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). [Crossvalidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) is the Stack Overflow of Data Science. And Stack Overflow is also popular.


### The Data Science Process

Uses an actual data science project.

1. Form the question
1. Find/generate the data
1. Analyze the data
1. Explore the data
1. Model the data
1. Communicate findings to others
